            A Membership Table implementation using Apache Zookeeper 3.4.6 https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.6/
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            A brief overview of ZK features used: The data is represented by a tree of nodes (similar to a file system). 
            Every node is addressed by a path and can hold data as a byte array and has a version. When a node is created, 
            its version is 0. Upon updates, the version is atomically incremented. An update can also be conditional on an 
            expected current version. A transaction can hold several operations, which succeed or fail atomically.
            when creating a zookeeper client, one can set a base path where all operations are relative to.
            
            In this implementation:
            Every Orleans deployment has a node   /UniqueDeploymentId
            Every Silo's state is saved in        /UniqueDeploymentId/IP:Port@Gen
            Every Silo's IAmAlive is saved in     /UniqueDeploymentId/IP:Port@Gen/IAmAlive
            IAmAlive is saved in a separate node because its updates are unconditional.
            
            a node's ZK version is its ETag:
            the table version is the version of /UniqueDeploymentId
            the silo entry version is the version of /UniqueDeploymentId/IP:Port@Gen
